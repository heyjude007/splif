An application to split the individual frames from GIF files and save them as JPG files

This is pretty simple, it uses the Pillow extension to extract the indiviudal frames from a GIF file and saves them as a JPG.

This was made at the request of fellow programmer and dear friend of mine [@OfficialJavaScript](https://github.com/OfficialJavaScript), who needed it for another project we are currently working on.

This is currently a CLI tool but I plan to make a GUI version using Tkinter at some point in the future.
